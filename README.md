```

### Project Structure

```bash

advance-langflow/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.py                 # Main application entry point
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ web_operations.py       # Web interface operations and handlers
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ snapshot_operations.py  # Workflow snapshot management
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ prompts.py             # Prompt templates and management
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pyproject.toml         # Project dependencies and configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ uv.lock                # Lock file for dependency versions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .env                   # Environment variables (create from .env.example)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore            # Git ignore rules
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .python-version       # Python version specification
```

## Configuration
### Environment Variables

Create a .env file with the following variables:

```bash
# API Keys
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
LANGSMITH_API_KEY=your_langsmith_key
LANGSMITH_PROJECT=advance-langflow

# Application Settings
HOST=localhost
PORT=7860
DEBUG=True

# Database (if applicable)
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///./langflow.db
```

## Usage

### Starting the Web Interface
```bash
python main.py
```

The application will start and be accessible at `http://localhost:7860`

### Key Features

- Web-based Workflow Management - Create and manage LangFlow workflows through a web interface

- Snapshot Operations - Save and load workflow snapshots

- Prompt Management - Manage and version control your AI prompts

- Real-time Execution - Execute workflows in real-time with live results

### API Endpoints

The application provides various endpoints for:

- Workflow execution and management
- Snapshot creation and restoration
- Prompt template management
- System monitoring

## Development

### Dependencies Management

This project uses `uv` for fast dependency management. Key dependencies include:
- FastAPI or Flask for web framework
- LangFlow core components
- AI/ML libraries for workflow execution
- Web interface libraries

### Adding New Features

1. Add new route handlers in `web_operations.py`
2. Implement business logic in respective operation files
3. Update prompts in `prompts.py` if needed
4. Test thoroughly before committing
