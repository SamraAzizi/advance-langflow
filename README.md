PORT=7860
DEBUG=True

# Database (if applicable)
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///./langflow.db
```

## Usage

### Starting the Web Interface
```bash
python main.py
```

The application will start and be accessible at `http://localhost:7860`

### Key Features

- Web-based Workflow Management - Create and manage LangFlow workflows through a web interface

- Snapshot Operations - Save and load workflow snapshots

- Prompt Management - Manage and version control your AI prompts

- Real-time Execution - Execute workflows in real-time with live results

### API Endpoints

The application provides various endpoints for:

- Workflow execution and management
- Snapshot creation and restoration
- Prompt template management
- System monitoring

## Development

### Dependencies Management

This project uses `uv` for fast dependency management. Key dependencies include:
- FastAPI or Flask for web framework
- LangFlow core components
- AI/ML libraries for workflow execution
- Web interface libraries

### Adding New Features

1. Add new route handlers in `web_operations.py`
2. Implement business logic in respective operation files
3. Update prompts in `prompts.py` if needed
4. Test thoroughly before committing

## Modules

### main.py
Main application entry point containing:

- Application initialization
- Route definitions
- Server configuration

### web_operations.py
Web interface operations including:

- HTTP request handlers
- Workflow execution endpoints
- UI rendering logic
